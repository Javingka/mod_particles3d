# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

#ignore gvim editing files (or are buffers?, i don-t know, but just ignore .swp)
**/*.swn
**/*.swo
**/*.swp

#ignore AWS data
/olds
